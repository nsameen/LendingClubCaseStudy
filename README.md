General Information
For a consumer finance company specializing in providing various types of loans to urban customers. When a loan application is received, the company must evaluate the applicantâ€™s profile to determine loan approval. Given the dataset (Loan.csv) includes details of past loan applicants and whether they defaulted. The objective is to identify patterns that can predict the likelihood of default, helping in decisions such as rejecting loans, lowering loan amounts, or offering loans to high-risk applicants at higher interest rates. The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
